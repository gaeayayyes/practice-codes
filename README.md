# **Gaea's Haven**

>We are all born beautiful, the greatest tragedy is being convinced we are not.

Hello, I am Gaea! I am 15 years old, born on the 27th of February. I am an INFP, which makes me a very creative and caring person. I lean more on depending on our feelings than being logical, unless it's a situation where I do need to be logical. If you want to know more about me then sit back and read through the rest of my webpage!

# **More about me:**

- I am a very slow person, mentally and socially.
  It takes me a while to process things and put things into words. Sometimes I mistake what people say and I still need others to repeat what they tell me multiple times just so I could finally get what is being said.
